But our concept is, to give a <strong>Perfect Jeans </strong>to the customer, which is  made only for him/her. You may order any waist size at the difference of only  half inches, so you can get waist of odd numbers too (Ex - 31.50", 34.50",  37.00"etc.), and same for all other measurements too. Also, you can get plus size jeans and jeans for odd body measurements.</div></td>
