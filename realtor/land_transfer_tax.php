                                Unless you live in  Alberta, Saskatchewan, or rural Nova Scotia, land transfer taxes (or property  purchase tax) are a basic fact of life. These taxes, levied on properties that  are changing hands, are the responsibility of the purchaser. Depending on where  you live, taxes can range from a half a per cent to two per cent of the total  value of the property<br>
                                <br>
                                Many provinces have multi-tiered taxation systems that can prove  complicated. If you purchase a property for $260,000 in Ontario, for example,  .5 per cent is charged on the first $55,000, 1 per cent is charged on $55,000 -  $250,000, while the $250,000 - $400,000 range is taxed at 1.5 per cent. Your  total tax bill? $2,375.00.</td>
