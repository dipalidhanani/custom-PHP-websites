Many people are  surprised at the additional costs over and above the price of the home.  According to the CMHC and Glenworth Financial you should have at least 1.5% of  the purchase price for closing costs in addition to the down payment (have  around 2.5% to be on the safe side). The costs vary among provinces and cities.<br>

                                Below you will find a brief explanation of these  costs. Please note these are some of the closing costs you may encounter  depending on your specific situation.
