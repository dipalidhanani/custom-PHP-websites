                                To obtain a  conventional mortgage, home buyers are required to put down at least <strong>20%</strong> of the purchase price or appraised value (whichever is less) as a down payment.  If you don't have the necessary time or resources to save a full <strong>20%</strong> down payment, you can choose a high-ratio mortgage and buy a home with a down  payment of as little as <strong>5%</strong>. This option is called a high-ratio mortgage  and it requires you to purchase default insurance.<br>

                                Whether you choose  a conventional or a high-ratio mortgage, one thing is almost always certain:  the larger your down payment, the more you save in the long run.<br>

The withdrawn amount must be repaid within 15 years, subject  to a minimum annual repayment that is 1/15 of the amount withdrawn.

                            </strong>CMHC or Genworth  Financial may insure a mortgage for up to <strong>95%</strong> of the lending value of  the house. Therefore, purchasers do not need a large down payment. Eligible  borrowers include anyone who buys a home in Canada intending to occupy it as  their principal residence. And the availability of government-backed mortgage  insurance is restricted to homes with a value of $1 million or less<br>
                            <br>
                            Purchasers can use  up to <strong>39%</strong> of their gross family income for payments of mortgage  principal and interest, property taxes and heating. A buyer's total debt load  (including consumer loans, etc.) cannot exceed <strong>44%</strong> of the gross family  income.<br>
                            <br>
                            People who insure a mortgage loan with CMHC or Genworth pay a premium.  The premium is based on the down payment and loan amount. A list of the mortgage  insurance premiums can be found <span class="red"><a href="http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/moloin/moloin_005.cfm" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</span></td>
