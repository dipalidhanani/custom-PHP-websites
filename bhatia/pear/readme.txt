This folder contains the PEAR modules that are used in the sniPEAR framework. It may also contain some other open source code such as the phpmailer code.
We encourage developers to use as much of the PEAR code as possible and will endevour to include it in the framework. 

Please note that some modules have been modified slightly from their PEAR default. This has been to facilitate development and ease of depolyment and is kept to a limit as much as is practical.
